<p>A student is primarily a person enrolled in a school or other educational institution who attends classes
 in a course to attain the appropriate level of mastery of a subject under the guidance of an instructor and who 
 devotes time outside class to do whatever activities the instructor assigns that are necessary either for class 
 preparation or to submit evidence of progress towards that mastery. In the broader sense, a student is anyone who 
 applies themselves to the intensive intellectual engagement with some matter necessary to master it as part of some 
 practical affair in which such mastery is basic or decisive.

In the United Kingdom and India, the term "student" denotes those enrolled in secondary schools and higher 
(e.g., college or university); those enrolled in primary/elementary schools are called "pupils."
